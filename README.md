# Spheroid
A function to find the most repressentativ Spheroid.

First, the length and width of the spheroid must be determined with a method of choice 
(in the future, this script might be extended to create an internal function for this purpose).  
Please save the data as an Excel file. Use Spheroid_tempelate for this.  
Afterwards the Excel file will be the input for this Python script. 
It can be used for the evaluation and is capable of finding a spheroid that optimally represents the subpopulation of spheroids for one of the experimental conditions over a period of several days.  
In addition, this script makes it possible to examine the roundness and area of the spheroids and to plot their changes automatically against the course of time.  

For a more user-friendly application, check out the Spheroid_user_interface.ipynb.  

Please feel free to use and adapt this script as far as you like.  
have fun :grin:
